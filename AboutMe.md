ABOUT ME

Hi, I’m @madeline-mapes. I created my page to serve as a portfolio to showcase and track my past and current projects in the analytical space.

I am a current graduate student pursuing my Master's of Science in Business Analytics at the University of San Diego. In addition to mu Master's degree, I graduated from the University of San Diego with a Bachelor's of Business Administration, after completing a double major in Business Analytics and Marketing and a minor in Spanish. 

Data and research has long been an interest of mine, and being able to pursue these interests in both an academic and professional setting has provided me with opportunities to develop new skills, strengthen my knowledge, and affirm my passion for transforming data into actionable insights. My background in business analytics has equipped me with a comprehensive technical skillset. I am proficient in Python and R, and am well experienced in using SQL to query, manipulate, and create databases. In addition, I am confident using both Tableau and Power BI to create data visualizations and dashboards.

I am eager to leverage my business analytics expertise, coupled with my marketing background, to drive data-driven strategies and innovative solutions in the business world. I'm particularly interested in roles that blend analytics with marketing approaches, where my skills can contribute to making a meaningful impact on the business and customers.
